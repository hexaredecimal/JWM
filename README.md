## Todo:
> Change the icons.

> Bind apps to their icons

> Fix the memory issues (Atleast improve it)

> Add thread support

## Supported Applications
* WebBrowser
* FileManager
* Text editor (Multiple programming language support)
* MineSweeper
* Math Graph plotter
* Calculator
* Terminal

## Why?
* ### Fun
  >>> When I started this project I had finished writing my exams, so to "relax" I chose to write a desktop environment (Kind of) using the language I'm learning at school... JAVA!
* ### Why Not
  >>> Not every idea is a good one, but an acedemic person, experiments are part of my daily life. So this is an experiment on how performant the JDK is.

## Future?
* ### Kotlin
  >>> Recently picked up Kotlin, I'm loving it. Maybe a Kotlin based rewrite or interop may happen. I don't know... If I get time.

## Contribution
* Feel free to port your java programs to this project. Any program is accepted as long as it is useful and not already there.
* Code improvements are super welcome, coz I kinda suck.
