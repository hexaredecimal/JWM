Plane
=====

A cartesian plane to plot functions, in Java.

I have developed this class because I need it for another project, and now
I am isolating this part because I believe it can be useful for others or
even for me in the future.

Features
========

These are some available features:
  - Axis y and x with metrics
  - Grid
  - Zoom using mouse wheel
  - Use of scale a:b
  - Plot of math functions

How to use
===========

See Test.java for some examples.
